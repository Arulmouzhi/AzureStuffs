Q:
Out of below 2 servers, We need to find which one is 'Microsoft Azure Synapse Analytics'? Other might be 'SQL Database'.
1. testservername0001.database.windows.net
2. testservername0002.database.windows.net

How to find easily?

Note - 
For "Dedicated SQL pool (formerly SQL DW)" , the endpoint would be same as SQL Database ".database.windows.net" [Still pricing tier is different: DTU/vCore Vs cDWU]
Under "Azure Synapse Workspace" - created "Dedicated SQL pool", the endpoint would be ".sql.azuresynapse.net"
Under "Azure Synapse Workspace" - created "Serverless SQL pool", the endpoint would be "-ondemand.sql.azuresynapse.net"

A: 
By knowing "Database Engine edition of the instance of SQL Server installed on the server.", we can find this.
How to know?
Run below SQL Query: 
SELECT SERVERPROPERTY ('EngineEdition'); 
that would return integer value:
5 => means "SQL Database"
6 => means "Microsoft Azure Synapse Analytics"
8 => means "Azure SQL Managed Instance"
11 => means "Azure Synapse serverless SQL pool"
