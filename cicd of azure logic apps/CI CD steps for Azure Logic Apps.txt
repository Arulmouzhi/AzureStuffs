CI CD steps for Azure Logic Apps

1. Create 1 Azure logic App for dev [in visual studio (i've used 2017) ]. New project-->Visual C# --> Web --> Cloud --> Azure Resource Group --> Logic App as template and click Ok.
	Right click on the Resource Group and select Deploy --> New --> [Create new RG and choose it], provide logic app name and deploy.
	Once we received the message in output window ["Successfully deployed template 'logicapp.json' to resource group '<RG name>'."], 
	then we can go for the deployed file path,	eg., C:\Users\<PC name>\source\repos\AzureResourceGroup3\AzureResourceGroup3\bin\Debug\staging\AzureResourceGroup3\ +........
	and copy 3 files [1.Deploy-AzureResourceGroup.ps1 ; 2.LogicApp.json ; 3.LogicApp.parameters.json]
	By this way, we created blank azure logic app.
	[Note: in visual studio(2017 we used) , View--> Cloud Explorer, we can able to see azure resources once we connected with our account]
2. Create Github new repos for test[open Github account if don't have any - free only] and use 'git' to locally clone it. [git clone <url>] . Also go to Marketplace and install microsoft's 'Azure pipelines'.
    Paste those copied 3 files in the local repos and push to remote repos.
3. Go to Azure Devops [dev.azure.com] and create 1 test project under organization. within organization's project, go to Pipelines-->pipelines--> New pipeline.
   <follow CI folder pics attached> In 'ARM template deployment' option, choose required 'Subscription' under both Azure Resource Manager connection+Subscription options.
   Also provide required RG,location, then Template=LogicApp.json and Template parameters=LogicApp.parameters.json 
   In Copy Files task, choose Target Folder=$(build.artifactstagingdirectory)
   Enable Continuous Integration under Triggers Tab. [branch filter eg., include master]
4. Within project, go to Pipelines-->Releases--> + New Release Pipeline.
	Select a template as Empty job and give stage name and click save and ok. then Add an artifact and choose 'CI pipeline' there and click Add.
	Select tasks within stage, under Agent Job, choose microsoft's  'ARM template deployment' and choose required 'Subscription' under both Azure Resource Manager connection+Subscription options.
   Also provide required RG,location, then Template=$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/_TestProject-CI (1)/drop/LogicApp.json 
   and Template parameters=$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/_TestProject-CI (1)/drop/LogicApp.parameters.json
    Enable 'Continuous deployment trigger' in artifact section with no filters.
	Select Trigger as 'After release' under 'Prod-CD_4m_Dev-CI' stage's 'Pre-deployment conditions'.
	During PROD deployment, it will auto-create even if the resource is not there, [anyway we have created resource group for PROD as minimum well before]

-- To check:
Make code changes in local[if we feel more comfortable in azure portal's designer view, then develop there and then in code view, copy code (actions,triggers,parameters etc., as you changed) ] and paste in to our local branch and raise PR for master/main. 
Once PR is approved, CI will initiate and after successful CI step, CD will initiate and deploy codes in 'Prod-CD_4m_Dev-CI' stage.

Note : the above are applicable for 1 Azure Logic App alone. For >1, just exploring, will update soon.
