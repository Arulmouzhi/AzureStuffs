azure keyvault - azure databricks - secret Scope ==> mainly used for hiding the credentials within Code and improve security.

1. Create keyvault instance with standard pricing tier. [Properties: Copy both 1.Vault URI/DNS Name and 2.Resource ID]
2. Go to url : https://<databricks-instance>#secrets/createScope  eg., <databricks-instance> = adb-<16-digit-id>.<2-digit-id>.azuredatabricks.net/?o=<16-digit-id>
   <pic attached for ref --> createScope-pic.png>  [Please Note down the 'secret scope name' that we are going to use in our sample scripts later]
   Once we created the secret scope in databricks environment, then under keyvault-->Access policies --> we can able to see AzureDatabricks under APPLICATION option.
3. In Keyvault, we can able to use Secret --> Generate/Import --> provide name, Value[password/actual secret credential that we want to hide] and choose upload options as Manual.

4. Check the attached sample script [sample scala script(Attached): sample sql query for storing data in azure sql db by HIDING credentials]

Note --> 
1. After we used credentials from keyvault, even in Resultset, it will be kept as secret. [REDACTED]   
2. we can also use Revision History --> Git Sync option to keep our changes in notebooks up-to-date.
